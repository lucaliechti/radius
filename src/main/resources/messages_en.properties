index.title=Radius: two opinions \u2013 one dialogue
index.subtitle=The web app Radius offers a simple way to discuss personally and constructively with citizens with different opinions.
index.about.title=What it's about
index.about=We believe in respectful dialogue between people with different political opinions. That is why we want Radius to make it possible for people with different views to discuss politics simply, personally and constructively. These discussions offer the opportunity to rethink one's convictions together and to understand other positions. This step out of one's own comfort zone not only promotes exchange between people, but also strengthens democracy.
index.works.title=How it works
index.works=Based on five yes-no questions and your geographical availability, Radius finds a person who is as interested in a controversial conversation as you are. The discussion material will certainly not run out, because the web app selects the discussion partners in such a way that their answers do not agree on as many questions as possible. Meeting up personally, you will have the opportunity to exchange views on various political topics.
index.interested=Are you interested?
index.interested.1=Yes, I would like to support the project
index.interested.2=Yes, notify me (one time only) as soon as Radius is online
index.error=Something went wrong. Did you enter a valid email address?
index.success=You have been successfully added to the reminder list.
