about.title=About Radius
about.works=How it works
about.works.detail=The aim of Radius is to enable real encounters between people with different opinions. This works as follows:<br><br>1. You create a profile in a few minutes. You answer up to ten yes-no questions and indicate your geographical availability. You also decide whether you want to search alone or in pairs for a meeting.<br>2. As soon as you activate the search function in your profile, you can be assigned to a conversation partner at any time. We make such an assignment once a day. In doing so, we prioritize allocations with the greatest possible differences in answering the questions. Important: It can take a few days until we find a hit for you.<br>3. Once we have found a hit for you, your e-mail addresses are automatically exchanged. You then organize your meeting yourself.
about.rules=Rules of the game (our advice for your meeting)
about.rules.detail=You may not often arrange to meet someone you don't know and who has different views. For your safety and for a good success of your meeting we therefore put the following points to your heart.<br><br>- Meet at a public place, like for example a café.<br>- Always stay friendly.<br>- Give your best to understand the arguments of your counterpart.<br>- Be prepared to admit insecurity and to question your arguments once in a while.<br>- The questions on Radius are chosen so that they allow lively discussions. But feel free to discuss anything and everything.
about.legal=Important note
about.legal.detail=If you use Radius, you agree to the following points:<br><br>- If your search function is activated, the email addresses will be exchanged automatically when a match is made.<br>- Radius is not responsible for any subsequent encounters. They are the sole responsibility of the participants.
