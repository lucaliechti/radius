home.title=Welcome to Radius!
home.welcome.title=The idea
home.welcome.details=The web app Radius offers an easy way to meet people with different opinions and start a personal and constructive discussion with them.<br><br>And here's how it works: Based on your answers to five yes-no questions and your geographical availability, Radius will match you with a conversation partner who is interested in a controversial conversation. You will certainly not run out of topics to discuss, because the web app matches people in such a way as to ensure that their answers to the questionnaire diverge as strongly as possible. Meeting up personally, participants will have the opportunity to exchange views on various political and ethical issues.<br><br>We wish you many interesting conversations!

about.title=About Radius
about.works=How it works
about.works.detail=The aim of Radius is to enable real encounters between people with different opinions. Here's how it works:<br><br>1. You create a profile in a few minutes. You answer five yes-no questions and indicate your geographical availability. You also decide whether you want to search for a meeting alone or in pairs.<br>2. As soon as you activate the search function in your profile, you can be assigned to a conversation partner at any time. We make such an assignment once a day. In doing so, we prioritize allocations based on the greatest possible divergence in the answers to the questionnaire. Important: It can take a few days until we find a match for you.<br>3. Once we have found a match for you, your e-mail addresses are automatically exchanged. You then organize your meeting yourselves.
about.rules=Rules of the game (our advice for your meeting)
about.rules.detail=You may not often arrange to meet someone you don't know and who has different views to boot. To ensure your safety and a successful meeting we would therefore advise you to take the following points to heart.<br><br>- Meet at a public place, like a caf\u00E9.<br>- Always stay friendly.<br>- Try your best to understand the arguments of your counterpart.<br>- Be prepared to admit insecurity and to question your own arguments once in a while.<br>- The questions on Radius are chosen so that they allow lively discussions. But feel free to discuss anything and everything.
about.legal=Important note
about.legal.detail=If you use Radius, you agree to the following:<br><br>- If your search function is activated, the email addresses will be exchanged automatically when a match is made.<br>- Radius is not responsible for any subsequent encounters. They are the sole responsibility of the participants.
